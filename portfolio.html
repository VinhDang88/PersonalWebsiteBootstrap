                "Where it all started. This lab brings back great memories that I wish to
                revisit. I had no idea what was in store for me. I remember vividly that
                all of these Youtube videos, coursera lectures, c# books for beginners
                were all telling me that I was already becoming a programmer simply by
                telling me to write "Hello World". I can't tell if this a funny joke or
                not."

                "This was the lab that made me think of the scene from the Matrix.
            <P> Morpheus : This is your last chance. After this, there is no turning back.
                You take the blue pill - the story ends, you wake up in your bed and
                believe whatever you want to believe. You take the red pill - you stay in
                Wonderland and I show you how deep the rabbit-hole goes." </P>

            <p> Morpheus : [to Neo who is choosing the red pill]
                Remember... all I'm offering is the
                truth. Nothing more.</p>

            <p> Yup... their was no going back from this. First week conditional statements,
                loops, declaring variables, cool. What the hell is a GitHub....?
                Couple weeks in you're learning collections and catching errors
                with exceptions and some basic Object Orientation Program (OOP).
                I've met my match. I still felt uncomfortable with creating a
                basic method and now they want me to call a method outside of a class?
                After some trial and error I felt like my brain made its fifteenth
                "A-HA" moment." </p>

                    <h2>Shopping List Group Project</h2>

                </a>

            <p>
                Here I am. My first group project. Nervous. Excited. Confused.
                Somewhat optimistic about the whole process. This was going to be
                the moment that you were going to be tested on a lot of the topics
                that we've covered in the past. Addding in another element,
                teamwork. </p>

            <p>We've all had good and bad experiences when it comes
                to group projects in the past. Some team members are quiet, some
                loud. Some are hard working, some nothing. However, not to get all
                poetic with you, but this is where chemistry is made with people.
                You work with what you got and you move on. My partners
                Kris and Mara were pleasant to be around. </p>


            <p> Kris was a monster machine. Making sure no one could break our code.
                And I mean no one. Well, I think his daughter did break it once..?
            </p>

            <p> Mara, the logical killer. The brains of the operations. Their was
                not one syntax error she couldn't solve. </p>

            <p> Me? What did I do? I took the glory and ran with it.</p>
